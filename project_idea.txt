IBM Hack:
Project idea:
	The project is about grammar and syntactical correction based on the user inputs.
The idea was to use the "Text to speech " Watson service as one of the input.The input 
provided is worked on by a "Grammar correcting" API and the output is given out in the 
correct form.
	As an addition,a user login and an account is created where the all the input
given by the user is stored in an encrypted form in a database.This informaation can 
be used as a security tool to authenticate users for various login.
	The process of authentication is done as follows.The all the data is scanned 
and a unique question is posed to the user.Only an authentic user can answer the question
as its based on his provious inputs.this is helpful where passwords can be hacked and 
having a static question in security.
